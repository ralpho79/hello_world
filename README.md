<h2>My first github project</h2>
<p>The purpose is to assess if there are trading pairs & prices on Binance that would make an interesing triangle trade opportunity.
<p>The app is using Binance Test Network API so the API keys in the code are not "real" - don't get too excited!
<p>The solution works on my local only.

<p> Been trying to deploy it on Binder but Binance refuses :/ It throws an API Exception error. 
<p> No plans at the moment to resolve that (like, convince Binance to allow U.S. servers...?)
