<h2>My first github project</h2>
<p>The purpose is to assess if there are trading pairs & prices on Binance that would make an interesing triangle trade opportunity.
<p>The app is using Binance Test Network API so the API keys in the code are not "real" - don't get too excited!
<p>The solution works on my local only.

<p> Deployed it on Binder but Binance gives a finger :/ It throws an API Exception error. 
<p> mybinder hosts servers in the U.S., hence Binance says "Sorry mate".
